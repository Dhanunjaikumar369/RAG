# RAG


This repository implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model that enhances the performance of natural language processing tasks by combining document retrieval with text generation. The model is designed to retrieve relevant information from a corpus and generate high-quality responses, making it suitable for question-answering, knowledge-based queries, and conversational AI tasks.

## Features

* **Document Retrieval** : Retrieves relevant documents or passages from a large dataset or knowledge base based on a user query.
* **Generative Response** : Leverages a generative model to create coherent and contextually appropriate answers by using the retrieved documents as input.
* **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** : Combines the power of retrieval and generation to provide more accurate and knowledge-rich responses than standard generative models alone.
* **End-to-End Pipeline** : Provides a complete flow from user query input, document retrieval, response generation, and final output.
* **Customizable Retrieval** : Flexible document retrieval strategies to adapt to different use cases, such as domain-specific question answering or conversational agents.
* **Efficient Query Processing** : Efficient handling of queries by integrating relevant documents with real-time response generation.
* **Scalable** : Capable of scaling to large datasets and corpora for robust information retrieval and generation.

## Use Cases

* **Question-Answering Systems** : Enhances traditional QA systems by retrieving and integrating relevant knowledge before generating an answer.
* **Conversational Agents** : Improves chatbots by allowing them to reference specific documents or knowledge bases to provide more accurate and context-aware replies.
* **Knowledge-Based Queries** : Enables knowledge-intensive applications by retrieving data from a corpus and generating insightful responses.

## Project Structure

* **RAG Model Implementation** : Core components for the retrieval and generation steps.
* **Data Handling** : Methods for processing and managing the document corpus.
* **Query Processing** : Logic for handling user queries and passing them through the retrieval-augmented generation pipeline.
